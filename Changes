Revision history for Perl extension UUID.

0.15 Thu Dec 25 05:55:13 EST 2014
  - REALLY fix do_uuid() typo. Really.
  - Fix pointer problems on BSD
  - Removed uuid_copy() from BSD. How did that get there? =)
  - Added yet another test for OSX segfault!
  - Check and set -DPERL__UUID__UUID_BUF_SZ=?? in Makefile.PL
    (Should be the same everywhere, right? Right?)

0.14 Wed Dec 24 22:39:42 EST 2014
  - Fix typo in Windows do_uuid() for compiler fail on strawberry
  - Now checking for all header files instead of taking first
  - Added more detail for failed interface search
  - Added check for uuid struct size

0.13 Wed Dec 24 07:45:49 EST 2014
  - Split -luuid search into header file and interface type stages
  - Removed SvPV_nolen everywhere (buffer overflows)

  - Added support for non-e2fs systems (BSD, OSX, Win)

0.11_01 Tue Dec 23 20:23:29 EST 2014
  - Modified test.pl to hopefully catch where MacOSX fails
  - Heavy mods to Makefile.PL to differentiate between interfaces
  - Makefile.PL *lots* more verbose
  - Lots of #ifdefs added in XS
  - First shot at code that works for BSD style interface

0.11 Mon Dec 22 19:03:09 EST 2014
  - Looks like I've managed to cut the failure reports down a little TOO
    far, so now splitting the search for -luuid into two separate
    phases. The first, which I don't want to deal with right now, tests
    for usability of the -luuid flag by itself. The second, tests for
    usability of individual functions. We'll deal with platforms that
    actually find libuuid first, then MAYBE revisit others.
