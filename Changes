Revision history for Perl extension UUID.

0.11_01 Tue Dec 23 20:23:29 EST 2014
  - Modified test.pl to hopefully catch where MacOSX fails
  - Heavy mods to Makefile.PL to differentiate between interfaces
  - Makefile.PL *lots* more verbose
  - Lots of #ifdefs added in XS
  - First shot at code that works for BSD style interface

  - Looks like I've managed to cut the failure reports down a little TOO
    far, so now splitting the search for -luuid into two separate
    phases. The first, which I don't want to deal with right now, tests
    for usability of the -luuid flag by itself. The second, tests for
    usability of individual functions. We'll deal with platforms that
    actually find libuuid first, then MAYBE revisit others.
